### ‚úÖ What is an Index?

An **index** in MongoDB is a **separate data structure** that holds an **ordered list of values** for a specific field (e.g., `seller`), along with **pointers** to the corresponding documents in the collection.

### üîç Why Use an Index?

- MongoDB **by default** performs a **collection scan** when no index exists.
  - It checks **every document** in the collection to find matching results.
  - This can be slow for **large collections** (thousands/millions of documents).
- If you create an index on a field (e.g., `seller`):
  - MongoDB performs an **index scan**, which is **much faster**.
  - Because the values are **sorted**, MongoDB can directly **jump** to the relevant data.
  - Then it uses the **pointers** in the index to retrieve the **full documents**.

### ‚ö° Performance Benefits:

- Greatly improves performance for:
  - `find`
  - `update`
  - `delete` operations **that filter by indexed fields**
- Especially useful when only a **small number of documents** match the query condition.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Downsides of Indexes:

- **Indexes are not free** ‚Äì they come with trade-offs:
  - Every **insert**, **update**, or **delete** must also update the index.
  - If you have **many indexes**, each insert/update becomes **slower**.

> Example: If you create 10 indexes on a document, every insert has to update **10 structures**, not just the document itself.

---

### üß† Key Takeaways:

- ‚úÖ Use indexes to speed up **read-heavy** operations.
- ‚ùå Avoid over-indexing; it hurts **write performance**.
- üîé Be strategic ‚Äì index fields that are **frequently queried**.
- üìä Always **measure** whether an index improves performance.

# MongoDB Indexing: A Practical Walkthrough

This guide provides a hands-on demonstration of how MongoDB indexes improve query performance, using a sample dataset of 5000 dummy contact documents.

---

## üß© Step-by-Step Overview

### 1. **Setup**

- Ensure you have a running MongoDB server.
- Download the `persons.json` dataset (an array of 5000 dummy person documents).
- Open a terminal in the folder where `persons.json` is located.

### 2. **Importing the Dataset**

Use the following command to import the data into MongoDB:

```bash
mongoimport --jsonArray --db contactData --collection contacts --file persons.json
```

- `--jsonArray` ensures the file is parsed as an array of documents.
- This will create a database named `contactData` and a collection named `contacts`.

---

## üîç Exploring the Data

Connect to MongoDB and inspect a single document:

```js
use contactData
db.contacts.findOne()
```

Each document includes:

- `_id`
- `gender`
- `name` (embedded)
- `location` (with nested `coordinates`)
- `email`, `login`, `dob` (date + age), `registered`, etc.

---

## üîé Running a Query

Find all people older than 60:

```js
db.contacts.find({ "dob.age": { $gt: 60 } }).pretty();
```

Check how many matched:

```js
db.contacts.find({ "dob.age": { $gt: 60 } }).count();
// 1222 documents match
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Analyzing Query Performance with `explain()`

```js
db.contacts.explain("executionStats").find({ "dob.age": { $gt: 60 } });
```

- **Winning Plan**: Shows how MongoDB executed the query.
- Initially, this query performs a **COLLSCAN** (full collection scan), examining all 5000 documents.
- **Execution Time**: ~5ms (fast here, but inefficient for large datasets).

---

## üöÄ Creating an Index

Create an index on `dob.age`:

```js
db.contacts.createIndex({ "dob.age": 1 });
```

- `1` = ascending order; `-1` = descending.
- MongoDB can traverse both directions regardless of the sort.

### Benefits After Indexing

Run the same `explain()` again:

```js
db.contacts.explain("executionStats").find({ "dob.age": { $gt: 60 } });
```

Results:

- **Execution Time**: Reduced to ~3ms.
- **Winning Plan**: Now uses an **IXSCAN** (Index Scan) followed by a **FETCH**.
- MongoDB only scanned **1222 index keys**, not the full 5000 documents.

## üß† Key Concepts Recap

| Concept             | Description                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Index**           | A sorted list of values in a field with pointers to documents.   |
| **IXSCAN**          | MongoDB uses the index to find documents quickly.                |
| **FETCH**           | Retrieves the actual documents using pointers from the index.    |
| **COLLSCAN**        | Scans the entire collection (slow for large datasets).           |
| **Execution Stats** | Used to measure performance and see internal query plan details. |

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

- Indexes drastically improve performance for read-heavy operations.
- You can create indexes on top-level or embedded fields.
- Always use `.explain("executionStats")` to understand how MongoDB executes your queries.
